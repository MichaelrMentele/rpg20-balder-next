Welcome to Balder!

The smart, seamless, way to keep your RPG table games all fun and no slog.

How? We automate the boring stuff so the players and the GM can do what they do best -- create thrilling action, hilarious scenes, and epic moments.

Get to the action!

# What is Balder anyway?

Balder is like a multiplayer RPG video game you all play at once that is completely open-ended. You can play your tabletop adventure game (remove or around the table). It let's the GM run the game at the speed of thought without endless hours of prep.

The typical stack is a software abomination. Let's set aside remote play for a second, and assume we are living beyond pen and paper which is soooo slow.

In that case in the session at your table you might use:

- DnD Beyond for character sheets
- DnD Encounter for tracking..? Blegh
- Discord for scheduling, whispering, perhaps dropping loot, and posting recaps
- World Anvil, or notion or some kind of wiki for your world notes, and either homebrew content written who knows where or purchased content which you have to flip back and forth through
- Various chrome tab for music, rule look up, and so on

It's a bit of a hot mess to play at the table and everyone is rolling their own abomination. Stitching together XYZ pieces of software.

A few folks have gone in on all-in-one solutions like Foundry... but what if you don't want to be fully virtualized? It's a bit awkward to run (though I'm sure it's possible) if you want to sit at a table.

But this chaos, as inefficient, frustrating, as it is sometimes isn't even the problem. Some folks have found good solutions. And that's fine.

Balder has two big ideas.

First, Balder isn't just one app to prep and run your game -- it's a living breathing world that you and your players can play in.

Instead of the GM having to make every decision for every monster and every NPC -- they become a conductor of what matters, the action, the story, and the character development.

Wait, what does that even mean? Monsters and NPCs make their own choices (with the GM's approval). They talk. They attack. They drink a potion. They cower. They even talk with real audio! Voices are generated and stay linked to the same monster so that when you meet that dragon from session 1 on session 50 it has that same gravely voice.

Second, what if you could just play a module that you bought seamlessly? No setup. No hours of translating it into Roll20 or Foundry. Click a button. Upload it into your Story Map. Play.

Finally, yes, all the regular game basic stuff a VTT would automate is included, it knows about disadvantage and sneak attacks and all that.

Balder isn't yet another VTT. It doesn't re-hash the same nonsense. Balder is a whole new paradigm.

# Before the Session

You purchase content from the store. It goes straight into Balder. Now, you define what changes with time (if anything). Does the undead army attack on the 3rd week? You can set up those events in advance. Every time you advance time in the game, you see when these events occur so you can drop your players into encounters or share lore.

You go in and modify any of the content from the locations, the enemy groups

# Pretend Session with Balder

Let's say in the last session a dragon laid waste to the town your in and flown off with the Mayor who owed you a reward for another job.

The players can chase, they can wait, they can go on their merry way. You've prepped for these paths and have a few ideas about where things will go but you're 90% certain we are fighting this dragon.

Looking at your session storyboard you give a quick prepared recap of last time. Whatever they choose you are ready with the Story Map. It's a map of your adventure, but it has not just the locations, but changes dynamically (the players don't see most of it since they live in a fog of war -- but you see it all). The other parties, the monsters, the armies, the towns, all acting on their own AI behaviors as you fast forward through time.

With this living, breathing world before you the opportunities just about write themselves. That band of Frost Giants you programmed to maraud well they just happened across the dragons lair while it was out and are looting it -- attempting to subdue the dragon.

When your players arrive they find a scene of chaos.

Everything is tracked within the app but the tactical map for combat. Why? We love playing around a table. We may consider coming back to this in the future and/or integrating with tactical maps in Roll20.

Balder was created by a busy GM who also happens to be CTO of a VC backed startup and a player who happened to be a lead designer at Apple.

We were frustrated at stitching together several technologies, the learning curve and cost of VTTs like foundry, roll20, and so on. Just too complicated and hard to use.

We want our automation and we want it to get out of the way.

Don't get bogged down in:

- rules
- explaining who you are attacking
- waiting for the DM for every check or attack
- tracking the one billion details like rolls, loot, money count, and so on
- having to make decisions for NPCs in combat -- why can't they have an AI?

We want to get to:

- the awesome moments
- the danger
- the roleplay
- the loot
- the puzzles
- teamwork

To the fun!

So, we built something that isn't a VTT -- it's a controlled video game that you play live (or remote too!). What do I mean a "controlled" video game?

The monsters and NPCs in the game make their own decisions and move around the world without the GM having to tell them too. This gives a default to your game. Want to control them? Go ahead. Put them where you want them in the world, tell them what to do in combat!

But don't care if they use multi-attack or shove the PC or drink a health potion? Let them figure it out themselves!

This speeds up the pace of gameplay by up 2-10x because we all know the bottleneck to play is... making decisions and then updating whatever system you are using whether it's pen and paper (oh lord) or your character sheet in XYZ system.

# Map

Players move from location to location. GMs move from encounter to encounter.

## GMs

Build maps, create locations, and define pre-set encounters. Or drop in an ad-hoc encounter into a given location.

View how encounters relate to each other. If you want to swap an encounter do it with a drag and a click.

## Players

Navigate the world on the map. Pre-set events can happen to the team at the discretion of the GM automatically or the GM can drop in a custom event.

# Encounter System

Want to have a set voice for a bewildering number of NPCs and monsters? No problem. We use AI to generate a voice based on a text description and then forevermore that character will sound like that voice (just in case it survives or is a friendly).

# Combat Encounters

## GMs

Drop a combat onto your party with a drag and combat starts. Initiative rolls are made, stealth checks are rolled, and surprised is determined automatically (you can also toggle it).

Monsters and NPCs take their turns automatically -- you can select their default strategy if you want your NPCs to hide. Of course they can't actually know whether damage resolves or not without knowing their position -- which is why you as the GM need to approve the actions your NPCs and monsters take.

There is clear limitations, we aren't tracking things like:

- line of site
- amount of cover
- attacks of opportunity

That's because we don't want to get into the whole simulated tabletop and move the game fully virtual -- at least not yet (we have exciting plans for a touch screen tabletop that auto syncs with your minis -- give a star here if interested in this).

BUT we can track everything else such as initiative, temp hit points, damage, and so on.

Compared to DnDBeyond's encounter/combat tool its 10x more usable. Also, you can drag and drop loot. We auto track lost consumables like arrows with a "ground" section that the GM can then return X% back to owners.

We also have a whisper system for in-game messaging you want to be secret in case your rogue wants to pocket the super secret loot. Characters can take secret actions too.

Not sure what loot to have on the monsters? Ugh, how annoying. That's why we have the option to auto generate loot appropriate to the monster tier. You can always override this.

## Players

Sick of having to click and wait for dive animations on to hit and damage separately? Everyone else at the table is too. Click the action you want to take, and click a portrait. Done. The GM will approve the result or alter it i.e b/c of a monster/character reaction or cover or other homebrew.

Sick of other players taking way too long but hate having to manage a timer? Us too. That's why we have an optional turn timer with an auto skip b/c life's too short to freeze in analysis paralysis. Sorry Overthinker the Wizard this is fast paced combat and now your dead from hesitation.

We have all the basics you'd expect too like a game log.

# Journal

## GM

You have a journal that helps you know what your characters know. It has the encounters, the log for each one, the quests and their status. What is known about the plot. What information has been given.

Also, not everyone knows everythings... secrets are fun! That's why we make it clear for every piece of information who is in the know... and who is an ignoramus. Sally the Barbarian was home sick and missed out on the vow of secrecy in the cave of doom about the Cthulu monster attack? Sorry Sally it's going to hurt when mind your cultist party force you to join or die.

## Players

Remembering things is tough. That's why we have a log of everything you discovered.

You can see what the party knows... and more importantly what ONLY you know.
